# DGG Injector

DGG Injector is a Chrome and Firefox extension which allows the user to swap out any Twitch chat for [Destiny.gg's](https://www.destiny.gg/bigscreen) embedded chat (destiny.gg/embed/chat). 

[Destiny](https://www.twitch.tv/destiny) the streamer defers to his own website's chat rather than Twitch's. Because of good moderation, high engagement by Destiny and those in his sphere, and Destiny.gg's overlay in the streams themselves, it is by far the preferred chat with which to engage. 

aleksstevcic built the Chrome extension first as they felt comfortable with JQuery, but ran into firefox's guidelines that block it, so Firefox's is a better version of the app.

# Usage

* Can be used to replace Destiny's Twitch chat with the far more relevant Destiny.gg chat on Destiny's Twitch page, if one prefers Twitch's site
* Offers an easy solution when Destiny participates in Twitch streams that aren't on his main channel. Example: when he leaves to "play" in the [Rajj](https://www.twitch.tv/rajjpatel) Royale
* Many streamer's Twitch chats are an unmoderated mess. Watching anyone's Twitch with Destiny.gg's chat overlayed on top can be preferable

# TODO

Please message [Fythic](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Fythic) or ask their GitHub account [aleksstevcic](https://github.com/aleksstevcic) if you would like to contribute! Or just go ahead, really üå∫

### TODO Current 
Items currently on the To Do list for this project:

* An option to swap between different Twitch chats
* Save-able configuration settings on a per-channel basis

### TODO Road Blocks
Saving configuration settings on a per-channel basis seems to be tricky as Twitch seems to have security risks when loading an iframe from a different domain, and will refuse to load normal chat after the iframe is loaded. I'm guessing a good workaround is to embed both twitch chat and dgg chat in iframes, then those in another iframe, and see if that may bypass the networking issue, but I have no idea.
